10                     Computational   modelling   and   design
By way of   finite element analysis using   SAP2000 package the   jacket platform. introduced in   Lecture   4   can   be   simulated through the steps illustrated   as follows:
Modelling and analysis   phase
Step   1. Defining   the   grid   lines
   
Step 2. Defining the section properties for chords   and braces
   
Step 3. Defining the auto selection   lists   for the   chords   and braces
   
Step 4. Drawing the chords, plan braces, face braces and the representative tope   side   structure members
   
Step 5. Drawing the conductors using replication technique
   
Step 6. Drawing the conductor box at plan elevations by editing   and   adding   members
   
Step 7. Replicating the front row   of   the   conductors
   
Step   8. Incorporating the leg batters by modifying the coordinates at the pla代 写EA50JG Offshore Structural Design 10 Computational modelling and design

Step 9. Pinned supports   at   the   jacket base
   
Step   10. Defining   area   at   the   top   deck   level
   
Step   11. Defining   dead, live   and   wave   load   patterns
   
Step   12. Assigning dead and live area   loads   at the top   deck   level
   
Step   13. Assigning   wave, current   and   wind   load   characteristics   following   SAP2000   documents
   
Step   14. Defining LRFD design load   combinations
   
Step   15. Running analysis, displaying deformed shapes   and capture   the   support reactions
   
Design phase
Step   16. Choosing   the   design   code
   
Step   17. Choosing the design load   combinations
   
Step   18. Overwriting   the   chords   K-factor
   
Step   19.   Start design iteration until the analysis sections are the   same   as   the   design   sections

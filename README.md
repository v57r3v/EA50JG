5.1 Introduction 
This   section   describes the   loads   and   design   situations that must be   considered   in the   design   of   jackets.   The   design situations that must be considered depend on the code   of   practice   adopted.
5.2 ASD vs. LRFD Jackets      can      either   be      designed      to      allowable      stress      design      (ASD)    or      load      and      resistance      factor      design (LRFD) codes of   practice. The difference   between   the   two   methods   is   the   manner   in   which   the   relationship   between applied loads and member capacities are   handled.LRFD   codes   accounts   separately   for   the   predictability   of   applied   loads   through   the   use   of   load   factors   applied    to    the    required    strength    side    of   the    limit    state      inequalities      and      for    material      and      construction   variability      through    resistance    factors    on    the    nominal      strength    side      of    the    limit    state      inequality.      ASD   combines   the   two   factors   into   a   single   factor   of   safety.   By   breaking   the   factor   of   safety   apart   into   the   independent   load   and resistance   factors   (as   done   in the   LRFD   approach)   a more   consistent   effective   factor   of safety   is   obtained   and   can   result   in   safer   and   lighter   structures,   depending   on   the   predictability   of the   load types being used.
The   following   discusses both ASD   and   LRFD methodologies, however   it   is   important to   remain   consistent   within a given design to ensure that the code   implicit reliability is   achieved.
5.2.1         ASD
Historically   API   RP2A   WSD   [1]   has   been   the   dominant   design   code   for   offshore   structures   and   is   by   far   the most commonly adopted allowable   stress   code.
In    an    allowable      stress      check      the      loads      remain      unfactored      and      a      factor      of    safety      is      applied      to      the   characteristic resistance to obtain an   allowable resistance.
5.2.2            LRFDIn   LRFD   design,   partial   factors   are   applied   to   the   loads   and   to   the   characteristic   resistance   of the   element,   reflecting   the   amount   of confidence   placed   in   the   design   value   of each   parameter   and   the    degree   of risk   accepted   under   a   limit   state.   The   magnitude   of the   load   factor   represents   the   uncertainty   in   the   load   under consideration.       Partial   resistance      factors   are   applied   to   member   and   joint   resistances.   In   ISO      19902    [2],   different   partial   resistance   factors   are   used   for   steel   in   tension   (1,05),   compression   (1,18),   bending   (1,05)   and   shear   (1,05). For   design   to   NORSOK   N-003   [3] all   partial   resistance   factors   are   taken   as   1.15.   Different limit states are   considered   including:
Ultimate Limit State (ULS): corresponds   to   an   ultimate   event   considering   the   structural   resistance   with   appropriate reserve.
Fatigue Limit State (FLS): relates to the possibility of   failure under cyclic   loading.Progressive Collapse Limit State (PLS): reflects      the      ability      of   the      structure      to      resist      collapse      under accidental   or   abnormal   conditions.   In   the   ISO   terminology   this   is   referred   to   as   Accidental   Limit      State   (ALS).
Service Limit State (SLS): corresponds to criteria for normal   use   or   durability   (often   specified by the plant   operator).
Different types of   actions for design of   jackets and their   corresponding   ASD   and   LRFD   are   described   in the   following sections.
5.3 Functional Loads Unlike   onshore   structures,   functional   loads   on   an   offshore   platform   are   very   well   defined   owing   to   the   rigorous approach adopted to weight control. This   is   essential   when   the   majority   of structures   are   lifted   into   place   by   large   offshore   cranes   and   lift   weight   must   be   known   to   within   2%   accuracy   by   the   installation   contractor prior to lift.Methods   used   to   predict   these   functional   loads   have   changed   little   over   the   years   but,   with   the   continuing   trend to reduce weight,   it   can be   expected that   rigorous   control   of functional   loads   will   continue.   The   large   topside weights of 30,000 Te installed   on   first   generation   jackets   are now   the   exception   rather   than   the   rule   and the general trend is for   smaller topside   facilities   with   resultant   lower   jacket   weight   to   take   advantage   of   a lift-installed   jacket instead of   a heavier and more expensive launched   jacket.
5.3.1       Permanent   (Dead)   Loads
Permanent   actions   are   actions   that   will   not   vary   in   magnitude,   position   or   direction   during   the   time   period   considered.
Dead   loads   are   loads   resulting   from   the   weight   of the   platform   structure,   any   permanent   equipment   and   appurtenance structures which do not change with the mode   of   operation. Dead   loads   include   the   following:
●          Weight of   the   structure in   air,   including the   weight   of   grout   and ballast,   if   necessary.
●          Weights of   equipment, attachments   or   associated   structures   which   are permanently   mounted   on   the   platform.
●          Hydrostatic   forces   on   the   various   members   below   the   waterline.   These   forces   include   buoyancy   and hydrostatic pressures.   Sealed tubular members must be   designed   for   the   worst   condition   when   flooded or non-flooded.In   addition   to   dead   loads,   permanent   loads   includes   loads   imposed   by   self-weight   of equipment   and   other   objects that remain   constant   for long periods of   time, but   which   can   change   from   one   mode   of   operation   to   another or change during a mode of   operation as permanent   loads.   This   includes:
●          Weight of   drilling and production   equipment   that   can be   added   to   or removed   from the   structure;
●          Weight    of    living    quarters,      heliport      and      other      life-support      equipment,      diving      equipment,      and   utilities equipment, which can be added to or removed   from the   structure.
Dead or permanent loads are also commonly referred to   as   dry loads.
5.3.2       Variable   (Operating   or   Live)   Loads
Variable      actions      originate    from   normal    operation      of   the    structure    and    vary    in   position   magnitude    and   direction during the period considered. Variable loads include:
●          Weight of consumables,   supplies   and   liquids   in   storage   tanks;
●          Forces exerted   from   operations   such   as   drilling,   material   handling;
●            Vessel mooring and helicopter landing;
●            Loads   on   storage/laydown   areas;
●            Weight   of   marine   growth;
●            Ice   and   snow   Loads.
●            Forces   due   to   deck   crane   usage.
Variable loads are also commonly referred to a   live   loads   or   operating loads.
5.4             Fabrication and installation loads These   loads   are   temporary   and   arise   during   fabrication   and   installation   of the   platform   or   its   components.   During    fabrication,    erection      lifts      of   various    structural    components      generate      lifting    forces,      while      in   the   installation   phase   forces   are   generated   during   platform   loadout,   transportation   to   the   site,   launching   and   upending, as well as during lifts related   to   installation.
For    fabrication    and    installation    conditions      each    member,   joint    and    other    relevant    component    shall    be   checked for strength using the   internal   force:
Fd =   GT +   QT   +   T
Where:GT         is   the   action   imposed   either   by   the   weight   of the   structure   in   air,   or   by   the   submerged   weight   of the   structure   in   water,   during   the   transient   situation   being   considered,   including   any   permanent   equipment   or   other   objects   and   any   piles   or   conductors   installed   on   the   structure,   as   well   as   any   ballast   installed   in   or   carried by the structure;
QT    is the   action   imposed by the   weight   of   the   temporary   equipment   or   other   objects,   including   any rigging   installed or carried by the structure, during the transient situation being   considered;
T represents the actions from the transient situation being considered,   including:
●            when appropriate, environmental actions;
●          when appropriate,   a   suitable representation   of   dynamic   effects;
●          for lifting,   the   effects   of   fabrication tolerances   and   variances   in   sling   length;
●            for   loadout, allowances   for   misalignment;
●          for    transportation,      any    hydrostatic      and      hydrodynamic      actions      on    the      structure,      including      any   inertial actions resulting from accelerations of   the   structure
●          for installation,   the   lifting   actions   and hydrostatic   pressure   actions   on   the   structure.
5.4.1         LRFD
For   LRFD   partial   factors   must   be   applied   to   GT,   QT       and   T.   For   ISO    19902   the   load   combinations   to   be   considered and appropriate partial factors are given   in   Table   5.1.
Table   5.1   ISO   Partial   Load   Factors   for   transient   situations   [2]

5.4.2         ASDWhen   considering   transportation   and   launch   with   environmental   actions,   API   RP2A   allows   for   the   basic   allowable   stresses   for member   design may be   increased by   1/3.   This   increase   in   allowable   stress   cannot be   used for lift, fabrication or loadout and   cannot be used   for   cases   without   environmental   loading.
5.4.3       Fabrication
Fabrication   forces   are those   forces   imposed upon individual members,   component   parts   of   the   structure,   or   complete units during the unloading, handling and assembly in the   fabrication yard   (Figure   5.1).
Jacket    structures,    particularly    large    or    slender      structures,      or    those      with    particularly      slender      structural   components, should be reviewed to determine whether analysis for   fabrication   is required.
Where   such analysis is undertaken, consideration   shall be   given   to   the   sequence   and   to   the   completeness   of   fabrication (e.g. whether welding has been completed at particular   joints) in determining   action   effects.Specific   consideration   shall   also   be   given   to   the      stability   and   strength   of   structural   components   during   fabrication   and   to   the   need   for   any   temporary   supports   or   strengthening.   Adequate   support   for   equipment   subjected to temporary actions, such as for crane   footings,   should be   demonstrated.
In   addition   to   the   associated   permanent   and代 写EA50JG Offshore Structural Design – Jacket Platforms 5 ActionsJava
代做程序编程语言   variable   actions,   the   effects   of wind-induced   vortex   shedding   vibrations on long slender members during fabrication   should be   considered.

Figure   5.1                      Jacket   during   erection
5.4.4       LiftLifting   forces   are   imposed   on the   structure by erection   lifts   during the   fabrication   and   installation   stages   of   platform   construction.   The   magnitude   of   such   forces   should   be   determined   through   the   consideration   of   static and dynamic forces applied to the   structure during   lifting   and   from the   action   of   the   structure   itself.Lifting   forces   are   functions of   the weight of   the   structural component   being   lifted,   the   number   and   location   of lifting   eyes used   for the   lift,   the   angle between   each   sling   and   the vertical   axis   and   the   conditions   under   which   the   lift   is   performed   (see   Figure   5.2).

Figure   5.2                        Lifts   under   various   condition
Lifting attachments can be of   various   forms, including the following:
●          Padeyes,   where   a   shackle   pin   passes   through   a   hole   in   a   padeye   plate   attached   to   or built   into   the   structure, the sling being connected to the   shackle.
●          Trunnions,   where   the   sling,   or   an   eye   of a   sling,   passes   round   a   short   tubular   which   transfers   the   forces into the structure, and which allows rotation of   the   sling   around   the   axis   of   the   trunnion.
●          Padears, which are   similar to trunnions,   but   in   which rotation   of   the   sling   is not   intended.All   members   and   connections   of   a   lifted   component   must   be   designed   for   the   forces   resulting   from   static   equilibrium   of the   lifted   weight   and   the   sling   tensions.   Moreover,   API-RP2A recommends   that   in   order   to   compensate   for   any   side movements,   lifting   eyes   and the   connections   to the   supporting   structural   members   should be   designed   for the   combined   action   of   the   static   sling   load   and   a horizontal   force   equal to   5%   this   load, applied perpendicular to the padeye at the   centre of   the pinhole.All   these   design   forces   are   applied   as   static   loads   if   the   lifts   are   performed   in   the   fabrication   yard.   If,   however,   the   lifting   derrick   or   the   structure   to   be   lifted   is   on   a   floating   vessel,   then   dynamic   load   factors   should   be   applied   to   the   static   lifting   forces.   In particular,   for   lifts   made   offshore   API-RP2A recommends   two minimum values of   dynamic load factors: 2.0   and   1.35. The   first   is   for   designing   the   padeyes   as   well   as   all   members   and   their   end   connections   framing the joint   where   the padeye   is   attached,   while   the   second   is   for      all      other   members   transmitting   lifting      forces.   For   loadout      at      sheltered      locations,   the      corresponding   minimum   load   factors   for   the   two   groups   of structural   components   become,   according   to   API-RP2A,    1.5   and   1.15, respectively.ISO   19902   recommend   a   dynamic   load   factor   of   1.3   (1.1   if   heavy   lift   by   semi-submersible   crane   vessel   is used)   for   offshore   lifts   and   a   factor   of   1.1      for   onshore   lifts.   For   the      design   of   lifting   attachments   and   members   connecting   to   the joint   where   the   lifting   attachments   is   attached   this   should   be   combined   with   a   local   factor   of   1.25 for   lift   in   open   water   and   1.15   for   lift   onshore   or   in   sheltered   waters.
5.4.5       LoadoutLoadout   forces   are   generated   when   the jacket   is   loaded   from   the   fabrication   yard   onto   the   barge.   If the   loadout   is   carried   out by direct   lift, then, unless the   lifting   arrangement   is   different   from   that   to   be   used   for   installation,   lifting   forces   need   not   be   computed,   because   lifting   in   the   open   sea   creates   a   more   severe   loading   condition   which   requires   higher   dynamic   load   factors.   If loadout   is   done   by   skidding   the   structure   onto   the   barge,   a   number   of static   loading   conditions   must   be   considered,   with   the jacket   supported   on   its   side.   Such   loading   conditions   arise   from the   different positions   of   the jacket   during the   loadout phases,   (as   shown   in   Figure   5.3),   from   movement   of the   barge   due   to   tidal   fluctuations,   marine   traffic   or   change   ofdraft,   and   from possible   support   settlements.   Since   movement   of the jacket   is   slow,   all   loading   conditions   can betaken as static.

Figure   5.3                      Various   phases   of   jacket   loadout   by   skidding
Typical values of   friction coefficients for calculation of   skidding forces   are   the   following:
●            Steel   on   steel   without   lubrication:   0.25;
●            Steel   on   steel   with   lubrication:   0.15;
●            Steel   on   teflon:   0.10;
●            Teflon   on   teflon:   0.08.
5.4.6       TransportationThese   forces   are   generated   when platform   components   (jacket,   deck)   are   transported   offshore   on barges   or   self-floating.   They   depend   upon   the   weight,   geometry   and   support   conditions   of the   structure   (by barge   or   by   buoyancy)   and   also   on   the   environmental   conditions   (waves,   winds   and   currents)   that   are   encountered   during transportation. The types of   motion that a floating structure   may   experience   are   shown   schematically   in   Figure   5.4.

Figure   5.4                      Types   of   motion   of   a   floating   object
In order to minimize the   associated risks   and   secure   safe transport   from   the   fabrication   yard   to   the   platform   site, it is important to plan the operation carefully by considering,   according to API   RP2A,   the   following:
●            Previous   experience   along   the   tow   route;
●          Exposure time   and reliability   of   predicted   "weather   windows";
●            Accessibility   of   safe   havens;
●            Seasonal   weather   system;
●          Appropriate   return   period   for   determining   design   wind,   wave   and   current   conditions,   taking   into   account characteristics of   the tow such as size,   structure,   sensitivity and   cost.Transportation   forces   are   generated by the   motion   of   the   tow,   i.e.   the   structure   and   supporting barge.   They   are   determined   from the   design winds, waves   and   currents.   If   the   structure   is   self-floating, the   loads   can be   calculated   directly.   According   to   API   RP2A,   towing   analyses   must be   based   on   the   results   of model basin   tests   or   appropriate   analytical methods   and must   consider wind   and wave   directions   parallel,   perpendicular   and   at   45°   to   the   tow   axis.   Inertial   loads   may   be   computed      from   a   rigid   body   analysis   of   the   tow   by   combining   roll   and   pitch   with   heave   motions,   when   the   size   of the   tow,   magnitude   of the    sea   state   and   experience   make   such   assumptions   reasonable.   For   open   sea   conditions,   Table   5.2   gives   typical   design   values.   These   criteria   would   typically be   used   with   an   assumed   period   of   10   s   in   order   to   calculate   roll   or   pitch accelerations.
Table   5.2 Typical   transportation   barge   motion   criteria   [6]
When   transporting   a   large   jacket   by   barge,   stability   against   capsizing   is   a   primary   design   consideration   because of   the high centre   of   gravity of   the   jacket.   Moreover,   the relative   stiffness   of   jacket   and   barge   may   need to be taken into   account   together   with   the   wave   slamming   forces   that   could   result   during   a   heavy   roll   motion   of the   tow   (Figure   5.5)   when   structural   analyses   are   carried   out   for   designing   the   tie-down   braces   and the   jacket members affected by the induced loads.   Special   computer programs   are   available   to   compute   the      transportation      loads      in      the      structure-barge      system      and      the      resulting      stresses      for      any      specified   environmental condition.

5.4.7       Installation   (launching   and   upending)These      forces      are      generated      during      the      launch      of   a   jacket      from   the   barge      into      the      sea      and      during      the subsequent   upending   into   its   proper   vertical   position   to   rest   on   the   seabed.   A   schematic   view   of   these   operations   can   be   seen   in   Figure   5.6.

b.            Jacket   rotates   on   the   rocker   arms
c.               Jacket rotates and slides   simultaneously
d.          Jacket detaches completely   and   comes to   its   floating   equilibrium position
e.          Jacket   is   upended   by   a   combination   of controlled   flooding   and   simultaneous   lifting   by   a   derrick barge.The   loads,   static   as   well   as   dynamic,   induced   during   each   of these   stages   and   the   force   required   to   set   the   jacket into motion can be   evaluated by   appropriate   analyses,   which   also   consider the   action   of   wind,   waves   and currents expected during the   operation.To   start the launch, the barge must be   ballasted   to   an   appropriate   draft   and   trim   angle   and   subsequently   the   jacket   must   be   pulled   towards   the   stern   by   a   winch.   Sliding   of the jacket   starts   as   soon   as   the   downward   force   (gravity   component   and   winch   pull)   exceeds   the   friction   force.   As   the   jacket   slides,   its   weight   is supported on   the   two   legs   that   are   part   of the    launch   trusses.   The   support   length   keeps   decreasing   and   reaches   a   minimum,   equal   to   the   length   of the   rocker   beams,   when   rotation   starts.   It   is   generally   at   this   instant that the most   severe launching   forces develop   as   reactions   to   the   weight   of   the   jacket.   During   stages   (d)    and    (e),    variable    hydrostatic      forces      arise      which      have      to      be      considered      at      all      members      affected.   Buoyancy      calculations    are      required    for      every    stage    of   the    operation    to    ensure    fully    controlled,    stable   motion.    Computer    programs    are    available      to    perform      the      stress      analyses      required      for      launching      and   upending and also to portray the whole operation graphically.

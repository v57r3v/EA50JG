Submissions: Through submission   links   in   MyAberdeen.
You are   required to   keep your own electronic   and/or ‘hard’   copy   of   any   work   submitted.


Assessment criteria:
The assessment of the course works will   be   based   on various   items   include:
•       A    complete    package      of      calculations      from      concept      design    to      detailed   design.
•         Effective          presentation,             conveyance          and             communication          of          the   information   (2CGS   marks   for   each   of   the   assignments)   .   As   a   structural   Engineer   in design offices, you   need to   present your calculations to   other   members   of the   design team   and your   calculation   results will   be   used   by   other   Engineers to   continue the work   until the   stage   of construction   and   completion   of the   project. The way you   present your   calculations   should   flow   and   must   be   very   clear   to   everybody   not just   yourself.   You   need   to   use sketches, drawings, and diagrams throughout the   calculations.
•       Accuracy of the calculations   is also very important for the   same   reason   as   above.
•       A   sample   calculation   (2CGS   marks   for   each   of   the   assignments)   covering   the   whole   process   of the   design   is   required for   all   the   hand-calculations.   The   repetitions can   be   tabulated.Missing each of   the above criteria may result in reduction of   marks by one grade   bande.g.   if   the   calculations   are   complete   and   accurate   but   presentation   is   not satisfactory   the   grade   maybe   dropped   to   a   B   band.
All   calculations   can   be   handwritten   or   typed   in   the   provided   calculation   sheets   or a structured format   of your   own   choice.
The general   project description:The client requires the conceptual design of an offshore substructure to support   a   well   head   platform   in   a   water   depth   of   approximately   34.5m   (to   LAT).   Other   alternative    concepts    have    already    been    ruled    out    for    this    site,    leaving    steel   jacket   structures   as   the   only   viable   alternative.   This   assignment   covers   a   range   of   integrated   design   courseworks that   are   required   in the   conceptual   design   of   a   jacket.    Design    data    for   the   jacket    structure    is    included    accordingly    in    this   assignment.


The substructure is   required to   provide   lateral support toten 0.762   m   diameter   conductors   spaced   at   a   minimum   of   1.3   m   centres.   All   conductors   should   be   located within the conductor   bay outline shown   in   figure   below.
Functional   loading:
The    topside      loads    on      the      wellhead       platform.    topside      consist      of      dry       loads,   operating   loads and   live   loads.The    wellhead    deck    should    be    assumed    to      have      a      dry      load      of      2200    te      and   operating   load   of   1500 te. The   centre of gravity for the   dry   and   operating   loads   should   be assumed to   beat the centre of the topside at   26.5   m   above   LAT.
The   laydown area is shown   below and should   be assumed to   have a   load   limit   of 15   kN/m2.





Tidal   levels for the   platform. are given   below.
MSL   =   LAT +   1.87m
HAT =   LAT   +   3.60m
The storm stillwater   levels for different   return   periods are:
SWL   (1 year) =   MSL +   1.23   m                                                                            SWL   (100 year) =   MSL   +   2.01   m

For      braces      classified      as      K%      and      Y%    joints,    a   combined      K/Y      effect      should      be      accounted    for    through      the       corresponding   strength   and chord force factors   (i.e.,   Qu=K%   ×   Quk    + Y%   ×   QuY   and   qA=K%   × qAk    +   Y%   ×   qAY).The angles between   the braces should betaken   from   your computational model.
